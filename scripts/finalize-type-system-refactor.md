# Type System Refactor Finalization

This document outlines the final steps to complete the type system refactoring process.

## Completed Tasks

- ✅ Defined database-aligned type system in `src/lib/types.ts`
- ✅ Created enhancers for all entity types (Houses, Rooms, Events, Users, Applications)
- ✅ Refactored all API helpers to use the new enhancers
- ✅ Removed transformers directory
- ✅ Fixed import path for Sanity types

## Remaining Tasks

1. **Testing:** Run comprehensive tests to ensure all functionality remains intact:
   - API endpoints
   - Dashboard functionality
   - Form submissions
   - Real-time updates

2. **Documentation Updates:**
   - Update any remaining documentation references to transformers
   - Add examples of using the new enhancers in the developer documentation

3. **Component Verification:**
   - Verify all components are using the correct type imports
   - Fix any TypeScript errors in components resulting from the type system changes

## Migration Process for Components

When updating components to use the new type system:

1. Replace direct imports from `src/lib/types` with specific types:
   ```typescript
   // Before
   import { House, Room, Event } from '@/lib/types';
   
   // After
   import { House, SupabaseHouseOperations } from '@/lib/types';
   ```

2. Update component props and state types:
   ```typescript
   // Before
   interface Props {
     house: House;
   }
   
   // After
   interface Props {
     house: House; // House now extends SupabaseHouseOperations with sanityHouse property
   }
   ```

3. Access Sanity data through the dedicated property:
   ```typescript
   // Before
   const { name, location, description } = house;
   
   // After
   const { sanityHouse } = house;
   const name = sanityHouse?.name;
   const location = sanityHouse?.location;
   ```

## Future Improvements

1. **Type Generation:**
   - Consider implementing automatic type generation from database schemas
   - Explore schema sync between Supabase and TypeScript

2. **Testing Infrastructure:**
   - Add unit tests for enhancers
   - Create a test suite for type compatibility

3. **Developer Experience:**
   - Add VSCode snippets for common enhancer patterns
   - Improve type documentation with examples
