# Accelr8 Website and Dashboard System

## About Accelr8: Our Story and Vision

### Genesis
Accelr8 began when Daniel and Pat met at a Web3 co-living experiment in the Sierra Nevada mountains hosted by Cabin DAO. Surrounded by ambitious builders working on cutting-edge technologies, they witnessed firsthand how magical the right community can be. What started as late-night conversations about the future of work and innovation evolved into a vision: create a space in San Francisco where the world's brightest minds could live, build, and grow together.

This wasn't just about shared housingâ€”it was about creating an environment where serendipitous connections lead to outsized outcomes, where breakfast conversations spark midnight breakthroughs, and where the next generation of world-changing companies could begin.

### Evolution
Over time, Daniel and Pat built deep networks across technology and Web3. They organized events, hosted dinner gatherings, and connected builders who were working on similar problems. They recognized a pattern: when the right people come together in the right environment with the right incentives, innovation happens at an accelerated pace. Not through formal structures or rigid programs, but through organic connection and authentic collaboration.

Every event strengthened their conviction that community-driven innovation was the futureâ€”and that San Francisco needed a physical hub where this approach could flourish full-time.

### Accelr8 Today
Today, Accelr8 is bringing these learnings and vision to life through our hacker house in San Francisco. We've created a space designed specifically for AI and Web3 founders at the pre-seed and seed stagesâ€”those building the future right at technology's frontier.

Our 15-bedroom house in Nob Hill has become home to engineers, designers, and founders from diverse backgrounds but with a common trait: they're all exceptionally talented builders committed to creating something meaningful.

Through weekly house events, monthly hackathons, demo days, and daily interactions, our community is accelerating innovation in ways that traditional accelerators and incubators simply cannot replicate.

#### Impact So Far
- **40+ Founders** building next-gen startups in AI, Web3, and beyond
- **15+ Startups Launched** from ideation to successful funding rounds
- **100+ Community Events** including hackathons, workshops, pitch days, and social gatherings

### Future Vision
We believe we're just at the beginning of what's possible when you bring together the right people in the right environment. Our vision for Accelr8 extends far beyond a single house in San Franciscoâ€”we're building a globally connected network of innovation hubs that will reshape how talented people live, work, and create together.

#### Phase I: San Francisco Network
Our immediate goal is to create a network of innovation hubs across San Francisco, forming a powerful ecosystem of talent, resources, and opportunities for founders. By creating multiple nodes across San Francisco, we'll build critical mass for innovation, allowing members to tap into different sub-communities while maintaining the cohesive Accelr8 experience.

**Why a network matters:**
- **Talent density**: Multiple houses means more founders, engineers, and creators in proximity
- **Specialization**: Houses can develop unique focuses (AI, Web3, Biotech) while remaining connected
- **Local network effects**: Cross-house events, shared resources, and expanded opportunity networks

#### Phase II: Global Innovation Network
Our ultimate vision extends far beyond San Francisco. We're creating a global network of innovation hubs where the next generation of technology companies are born, all connected through a shared community of ambitious builders and entrepreneurs.

**The Accelr8 Network Advantage:**
- **Global Community**: Connect with brilliant minds worldwide
- **Talent & Co-founders**: Find your perfect collaborator
- **Remote Work**: Move between locations while staying connected
- **Launch Support**: Resources to help you scale globally
- **Prestige & Credibility**: Be part of a recognized network
- **Global Events**: Participate in cross-location collaborations

When you join Accelr8, you're not just renting a roomâ€”you're becoming part of a global network designed to accelerate your journey as a founder. Whether you need a co-founder, technical talent, investment opportunities, or simply a supportive community that understands the challenges of building, the Accelr8 network will be there to support you at every step.

### Our Guiding Principles
- **Community First**: We believe that meaningful connections between founders create exponential value. Our community is our greatest asset.
- **High Talent Density**: We curate our community to bring together exceptional people with complementary skills and shared ambition.
- **Innovation Through Interaction**: We foster an environment where serendipitous collisions of ideas and perspectives lead to breakthrough innovations.

## Project Context

### What We're Building
We are developing a comprehensive website and dashboard system for Accelr8, a hacker house organization. Currently, Accelr8 operates one house but has plans for rapid expansion to multiple locations. This system will serve as both a public-facing marketing website and a powerful internal tool for residents and administrators.

### Why We're Building It
As Accelr8 scales from one house to multiple locations, we need a centralized platform that can:
1. Present a unified brand and application process to potential residents
2. Provide residents with house-specific information and community tools
3. Give house administrators tools to effectively manage operations
4. Enable organization-level oversight across multiple properties
5. Support the company's mission of fostering a high-talent-density environment for founders

This platform will be critical to maintaining operational efficiency during expansion while preserving the community experience that makes Accelr8 valuable to residents.

## Data Architecture: Sanity CMS & Supabase Integration

We've implemented a sophisticated dual-database architecture that leverages the strengths of both Sanity CMS and Supabase while maintaining strong type safety through TypeScript.

### Architecture Overview

#### Core Principles 

1. **Single Source of Truth**: Each data entity has one primary location
   - Sanity: Content, public-facing data, media assets
   - Supabase: Operational data, user authentication, transactions

2. **Type Extension Pattern**: Composite types extend base types using TypeScript interfaces
   - Base types directly reflect database schemas
   - Composite types normalize and combine data from both sources

3. **Clear Data Origin**: Each property's source system is explicit and traceable
   - Properties are grouped by their origin
   - Naming conventions identify the data source

4. **Normalized Properties**: Consistent naming across systems
   - camelCase for all TypeScript interfaces
   - snake_case for Supabase database
   - Consistent property transformations

### Sanity CMS: Content Management

Sanity handles all **public-facing, editable content** that benefits from an editorial workflow:

- **House Profiles**: Descriptions, images, amenities, location details
- **Room Types**: Standard configurations, features, images
- **Person Profiles**: Public resident/team information
- **Public Events**: Organization activities, programs, hackathons
- **Media Assets**: Images, documents, videos

Sanity offers several advantages for this content:

- Rich editorial interface with customizable workflows
- Powerful image handling with hotspot support
- Structured content with references between types
- Version history and collaboration tools

### Supabase: Application Data & Operations

Supabase manages all **transactional, operational, and user-specific data**:

- **Authentication**: User accounts, roles, permissions
- **House Operations**: WiFi passwords, access codes, occupancy stats
- **Room Instances**: Current status, resident assignments, leases
- **Internal Events**: House meetings, private gatherings
- **Applications**: Prospective resident applications, interviews
- **Bookings & Transactions**: Resource reservations, payments

Supabase advantages for operational data:

- Real-time updates via subscriptions
- Row-level security for fine-grained access control
- PostgreSQL for robust relational data
- Serverless functions for business logic

### Type System Architecture

Our type system follows a clean extension pattern where composite types integrate data from both sources:

```typescript
// Base Sanity type
interface SanityHouse {
  _id: string;
  name: string;
  slug: { current: string };
  // Other Sanity fields...
}

// Base Supabase type
interface SupabaseHouseOperations {
  id: string;
  sanity_house_id: string;
  status: string;
  // Other Supabase fields...
}

// Composite type using extension
interface House extends Omit<SanityHouse, '_id' | 'slug'> {
  // Normalized Sanity properties
  id: string; // renamed from _id
  slug: string; // simplified from slug.current
  
  // Add operational data from Supabase
  operations?: {
    id: string;
    status: 'operational' | 'maintenance' | 'planned_closure';
    // Other normalized operational fields...
  };
  
  // Computed properties
  isActive: boolean;
  occupancyRate?: number;
}
```

This pattern provides several benefits:

1. **Type safety** - Changes to base schemas automatically propagate to composite types
2. **Clear data lineage** - Properties are traceable to their origin
3. **Normalized interfaces** - Consistent property naming across the application
4. **Computed properties** - Derived data based on multiple sources

### Data Fetching Pattern

Data is fetched from both systems and combined into composite objects:

```typescript
// Example: Fetching a house with operations data
async function getHouseData(houseId: string): Promise<House> {
  // Fetch data in parallel
  const [sanityHouse, operations] = await Promise.all([
    // Get content from Sanity
    sanityClient.fetch(`*[_type == "house" && _id == $id][0]`, { id: houseId }),
    
    // Get operations data from Supabase
    supabase.from('house_operations')
      .select('*')
      .eq('sanity_house_id', houseId)
      .single()
      .then(result => result.data)
  ]);
  
  // Convert to composite type
  return convertSanityHouse(sanityHouse, operations);
}
```

### Reference Management

Cross-database references are managed through ID fields:

1. **Sanity â†’ Supabase**: Reference fields in Supabase tables link to Sanity IDs
   - Example: `sanity_house_id` in the rooms table references a Sanity house document

2. **Supabase â†’ Sanity**: User profiles in Supabase can link to Sanity person documents
   - Example: User metadata contains `sanity_person_id` to reference their public profile

### Caching Strategy

A tiered caching approach optimizes performance:

1. **Content (Sanity)**: 
   - Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR) for public content
   - Longer cache lifetimes for stable content

2. **Operational Data (Supabase)**:
   - SWR (stale-while-revalidate) for frequently changing data
   - Real-time subscriptions for critical updates

3. **Composite Objects**:
   - In-memory or Redis caching for frequently accessed composites
   - Cache invalidation triggered by changes in either system

### Real-time Updates

For dynamic features, we use Supabase's real-time capabilities:

```typescript
// Subscribe to room status changes
function subscribeToRoomStatus(roomId: string, onUpdate: (room: Room) => void) {
  return supabase
    .from('rooms')
    .on('UPDATE', async (payload) => {
      if (payload.new.id === roomId) {
        // Fetch the complete room data and notify
        const room = await getRoomWithDetails(roomId);
        onUpdate(room);
      }
    })
    .subscribe();
}
```

### Entity Relationships

Our core entity model consists of these primary types:

1. **User/Person**
   - Authentication in Supabase
   - Extended profile in `accelr8_users` table
   - Public profile in Sanity `person` documents
   - Joined through references in auth metadata

2. **House**
   - Content details in Sanity `house` documents
   - Operational data in `house_operations` table
   - Joined through `sanity_house_id` references

3. **Room**
   - Type definition in Sanity `roomType` documents
   - Instances in Supabase `rooms` table
   - Joined through `sanity_room_type_id` references

4. **Event**
   - Public events in Sanity `event` documents
   - Internal events in `house_events` table
   - Optional cross-reference through `sanity_event_id`

5. **Application**
   - Entirely in Supabase with `applications` table
   - References to Sanity houses through `preferred_houses`
   - Creates Sanity person when approved

## Implementation Strategy for Data Integration

We've implemented a comprehensive integration strategy that leverages the type extension pattern to seamlessly combine data from Sanity CMS and Supabase.

### Type-First Development Approach

Our implementation follows a "type-first" development approach:

1. **Define Base Types**: 
   - Create TypeScript interfaces that directly match database schemas
   - Generate Sanity types using their schema-to-typescript tools
   - Define Supabase types that match SQL tables

2. **Create Composite Types**:
   - Extend base types using TypeScript's `extends` and `Omit` patterns
   - Normalize property names with consistent conventions
   - Add computed properties that derive from multiple sources

3. **Build Utility Functions**:
   - Create converter functions to transform raw data into composite types
   - Implement fetch helpers that retrieve and combine data
   - Handle error cases and fallbacks

### Authentication Flow

1. User authentication happens exclusively through Supabase Auth
2. After authentication, the application:
   - Fetches user metadata including role and `sanity_person_id` 
   - Retrieves the extended profile from `accelr8_users` table
   - If applicable, fetches the corresponding public profile from Sanity
   - Combines all data into a unified `UserProfile` object

```typescript
// Example user profile integration
async function getUserProfile(userId: string): Promise<UserProfile | null> {
  try {
    // Get auth data and metadata
    const { data: authData } = await supabase.auth.getUser(userId);
    if (!authData?.user) return null;
    
    // Get extended data from accelr8_users table
    const { data: extendedData } = await supabase
      .from('accelr8_users')
      .select('*')
      .eq('id', userId)
      .single();

    // Get Sanity profile if ID exists
    let sanityProfile = null;
    if (authData.user.user_metadata?.sanity_person_id) {
      sanityProfile = await sanityClient.fetch(
        `*[_type == "person" && _id == $id][0]`,
        { id: authData.user.user_metadata.sanity_person_id }
      );
    }
    
    // Create the composite user profile
    return {
      id: authData.user.id,
      email: authData.user.email,
      role: authData.user.user_metadata?.role || 'resident',
      onboarding_completed: authData.user.user_metadata?.onboarding_completed || false,
      
      // Add extended data if available
      extendedData: extendedData ? {
        emergency_contact_name: extendedData.emergency_contact_name,
        emergency_contact_phone: extendedData.emergency_contact_phone,
        phone_number: extendedData.phone_number,
        last_active: extendedData.last_active
      } : undefined,
      
      // Add Sanity profile if available
      sanityProfile: sanityProfile ? {
        id: sanityProfile._id,
        name: sanityProfile.name,
        slug: sanityProfile.slug?.current,
        profileImage: sanityProfile.profileImage,
        bio: sanityProfile.bio,
        // ...other fields
      } : undefined,
      
      // Computed properties
      isAdmin: authData.user.user_metadata?.role === 'admin' || 
               authData.user.user_metadata?.role === 'super_admin',
      isSuperAdmin: authData.user.user_metadata?.role === 'super_admin',
      isResident: authData.user.user_metadata?.role === 'resident'
    };
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error fetching user profile:', error);
    return null;
  }
}
```

### Content Delivery Strategy

#### Public Website
For public-facing pages, we implement a hybrid rendering approach:

1. **Static Content**: 
   - Use Next.js Static Site Generation (SSG) with revalidation
   - Fetch Sanity content at build time with incremental updates
   - Pre-render pages for optimal performance

```typescript
// Example of fetching houses for public display
export async function getStaticProps() {
  const houses = await sanityClient.fetch(`
    *[_type == "house" && active == true] {
      _id,
      name,
      slug,
      mainImage,
      shortDescription,
      "location": location {
        city,
        state
      }
    }
  `);
  
  return {
    props: { houses },
    revalidate: 3600 // Revalidate every hour
  };
}
```

2. **Dynamic Content**:
   - For personalized or real-time data, use client-side fetching
   - Combine static Sanity content with dynamic Supabase data
   - Implement SWR pattern for optimal user experience

```typescript
// Example: Room availability on house page
function RoomAvailability({ roomTypeId }) {
  const { data, error } = useSWR(
    `/api/rooms/availability?roomTypeId=${roomTypeId}`,
    fetcher,
    { refreshInterval: 60000 } // Refresh every minute
  );
  
  // Rest of component implementation
}
```

#### Dashboard Features

For authenticated dashboard features, we implement:

1. **Real-time Updates**:
   - Use Supabase subscriptions for live operational data
   - Update UI reactively as data changes
   - Optimize for responsiveness

```typescript
// Example: Event RSVP counter
function EventRSVPCounter({ eventId }) {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
  
  useEffect(() => {
    // Initial count
    fetchCurrentCount();
    
    // Subscribe to changes
    const subscription = supabase
      .from('event_participants')
      .on('INSERT', () => fetchCurrentCount())
      .on('DELETE', () => fetchCurrentCount())
      .subscribe();
      
    return () => supabase.removeSubscription(subscription);
  }, [eventId]);
  
  async function fetchCurrentCount() {
    const { count } = await supabase
      .from('event_participants')
      .select('*', { count: 'exact' })
      .eq('event_id', eventId)
      .eq('rsvp_status', 'attending');
      
    setCount(count);
  }
  
  return <div>Attending: {count} people</div>;
}
```

2. **Combined Data Views**:
   - Fetch and merge data from both sources
   - Transform into strongly-typed composite objects
   - Present unified interfaces to components

```typescript
// Example API route that combines data
export async function getRoom(req, res) {
  const { roomId } = req.query;
  
  try {
    // Get room data from Supabase
    const { data: roomData, error } = await supabase
      .from('rooms')
      .select('*')
      .eq('id', roomId)
      .single();
      
    if (error) throw error;
    
    // Get room type from Sanity
    const roomType = await sanityClient.fetch(`
      *[_type == "roomType" && _id == $id][0]
    `, { id: roomData.sanity_room_type_id });
    
    // Get house data from Sanity
    const house = await sanityClient.fetch(`
      *[_type == "house" && _id == $id][0]{
        _id, name, location
      }
    `, { id: roomData.sanity_house_id });
    
    // Convert to composite Room object
    const room = convertToRoomType(roomData, roomType, house);
    
    res.status(200).json(room);
  } catch (error) {
    res.status(500).json({ error: error.message });
  }
}
```

### Data Synchronization

For key entities that exist in both systems, we implement sync mechanisms:

1. **User/Person Creation**:
   - When a user is approved from an application, create both:
     - Supabase auth user with appropriate role
     - Sanity person document with public profile
     - Link them via reference IDs

2. **Event Publishing**:
   - Internal events can be "published" to create Sanity documents
   - Public events can have internal operational data in Supabase
   - Maintain references between systems via IDs

3. **Webhooks**:
   - Sanity webhooks trigger updates for critical content changes
   - Next.js API routes process webhook data and update Supabase
   - Handle synchronization of key reference data

### Error Handling and Resilience

Our implementation includes robust error handling and resilience mechanisms:

1. **Graceful Degradation**:
   - Components can render with partial data if one source fails
   - Fallback strategies use available data from either system
   - Clear error boundaries prevent cascading failures

2. **Data Validation**:
   - TypeScript interfaces enforce correct data structures
   - Runtime validation ensures data integrity
   - Conversion functions handle missing or malformed data

### Authentication System
- Registration flow
- Login system
- Password recovery
- Role-based access (resident, admin, super-admin)

## Authentication & Authorization Architecture

The Accelr8 platform implements a comprehensive authentication and authorization system using Next.js middleware and Supabase authentication. This system enforces robust access controls while maintaining a clean user experience.

### Authentication Flow

1. **User Authentication**
   - Authentication is handled by Supabase Auth
   - Login, registration, and password recovery flows are provided
   - Sessions are managed via cookies with proper security measures

2. **Route Protection**
   - All routes under `/dashboard/*` are protected and require authentication
   - Middleware intercepts requests to check for valid sessions
   - Unauthenticated users are redirected to the login page with return URL

3. **Role-Based Access Control**
   - Three user roles with increasing permissions:
     - `resident`: Basic access to resident features for assigned houses
     - `admin`: House management capabilities plus resident features
     - `super_admin`: Full access to all houses and features

4. **House-Specific Permissions**
   - Users only have access to houses they're associated with
   - Residents can only access their assigned houses (via `residencies` table)
   - Admins can only manage houses they're assigned to (via `house_admins` table)
   - Super admins have access to all houses

### Implementation Details

1. **Middleware Architecture**
   - Root middleware (`src/middleware.ts`) intercepts all requests
   - Auth-specific middleware (`src/lib/supabase/middleware.ts`) handles authentication logic
   - Clean fallbacks for authentication failures

2. **Dashboard Entry Point**
   - `/dashboard` serves as entry to house selection
   - Displays houses the user has access to based on their role
   - Admins see houses they manage, residents see houses they live in

3. **House Access Verification**
   - When accessing a specific house (`/dashboard/[houseId]/*`):
     - Middleware verifies the user has access to that house
     - Checks appropriate table based on user role (`residencies` or `house_admins`)
     - Redirects to house selection if access check fails

4. **Section-Based Permissions**
   - `/dashboard/[houseId]/resident/*` - Resident functionality (accessible to all users with house access)
   - `/dashboard/[houseId]/admin/*` - Admin functionality (only for admins and super admins)
   - Routing structure enforces clear separation of concerns

5. **UI Components & Navigation**
   - Navigation adapts based on user role and current section
   - Admins can switch between resident and admin views
   - Layout components handle conditional rendering based on permissions

### Security Considerations

1. **Multiple Verification Layers**
   - Client-side navigation restrictions
   - Server middleware protection
   - Database-level access controls
   - UI conditional rendering

2. **Principle of Least Privilege**
   - Users only see navigation options they have permission to access
   - Database queries are scoped to the user's role and assigned houses
   - Super admin privileges are strictly controlled

3. **Session Management**
   - Secure cookie handling
   - Proper token refresh
   - Session timeout management

## House Dashboard (Resident Portal)

When a resident logs in, they should be directed to their house dashboard with:

1. **Resident Home**
   - Personalized welcome
   - Important announcements
   - Upcoming house events
   - Quick links to common actions

2. **Community Hub**
   - Resident directory with profiles and skills
   - Messaging system for resident communication
   - Project showcase/collaboration board
   - Interest/skill matching for potential co-founders

3. **Events Calendar**
   - House-specific events
   - Organization-wide events
   - RSVP functionality
   - Option to propose events

4. **Resource Booking**
   - Meeting rooms
   - Common spaces for presentations
   - Equipment checkout

5. **Maintenance Requests**

   - Track status of existing requests

6. **House Information**
   - House rules and guidelines
   - Local area resources (grocery, coffee shops, etc.)
   - Emergency contacts
   - Wi-Fi information and tech support

7. **Billing/Payments**
   - Rent payment status
   - Payment history
   - Receipt downloads

## House Admin Dashboard

House administrators (house managers) can access an admin section directly within the house dashboard at `/dashboard/[houseId]/admin`. This provides a more integrated management experience tied directly to the specific house context. Key functionality includes:

1. **Admin Dashboard Overview**
   - House health metrics (occupancy, satisfaction, etc.)
   - Quick stats (pending maintenance, upcoming events)
   - Recent activity feed

**Solution**: Use Sanity webhooks to trigger updates to Supabase when relevant content changes.

### Performance Optimization
**Challenge**: Maintaining performance when fetching from two different systems.
**Solution**: 
- Use ISR for Sanity content
- Implement efficient caching strategies
- Create batched queries that minimize round-trips

### User Profile Management
**Challenge**: Managing user profiles across both systems.
**Solution**: 
- Store core user data in Supabase
- Create public profiles in Sanity when needed
- Link with consistent IDs

## TypeScript Types

Our TypeScript type system provides a robust foundation for the application, emphasizing type safety, clarity, and maintainability.

### Architecture

The type system follows a clean extension pattern with three layers:

1. **Base Types**: Direct reflections of database structures
   - `SanityHouse`, `SupabaseHouseOperations`, etc.
   - Generated from schemas or manually defined to match DB tables

2. **Composite Types**: Extended types that combine sources
   - `House`, `Room`, `Event`, etc.
   - Normalize property names and add computed properties

3. **Utility Types**: Supporting types and shared interfaces 
   - Common enums, shared interfaces, helper types



### Type Extension Pattern

Our composite types follow a consistent pattern that extends base types:

```typescript
// Example from src/lib/types.ts
import { House as SanityHouse } from "./sanity.types";

// Base Supabase type
export interface SupabaseHouseOperations {
  id: string;
  sanity_house_id: string;
  status: 'open' | 'planned' | 'closed';
  current_occupancy: number;
  wifi_network?: string;
  wifi_password?: string;
  access_code?: string;
  emergency_contacts?: Record<string, any>;
  maintenance_contacts?: Record<string, any>;
  cleaning_schedule?: Record<string, any>;
  operational_notes?: string;
  last_inspection_date?: string;
  created_at: string;
  updated_at: string;
}

// Composite type extending Sanity type with operational data
export interface House extends Omit<SanityHouse, '_id' | 'slug'> {
  // Normalized properties from Sanity
  id: string; // renamed from _id
  slug: string; // simplified from slug.current

  // Add operational data from Supabase
  operations?: Omit<SupabaseHouseOperations, 'sanity_house_id' | 'created_at' | 'updated_at'> & {
    // Normalized properties from Supabase
    status: 'operational' | 'maintenance' | 'planned_closure' | 'renovation';
    currentOccupancy: number;
    wifiNetwork?: string; // camelCase version of wifi_network 
    wifiPassword?: string;
    accessCode?: string;
    lastInspectionDate?: string;
  };

  // Computed properties
  isActive: boolean; // derived from active flag and operations status
  occupancyRate?: number; // calculated as currentOccupancy / capacity
}
```

### Key Benefits

This pattern provides several advantages:

1. **Type Safety**: Properties are automatically updated when base types change
2. **Clarity**: Clear separation between content and operational data
3. **Normalization**: Consistent property naming (camelCase) across the app
4. **Documentation**: Self-documenting code with type definitions
5. **Intellisense**: Better developer experience with autocomplete

### Unified User Types

User management is particularly complex as it spans authentication, extended data, and public profiles:

```typescript
// Base Supabase user data from auth.users (via metadata)
export interface SupabaseAuthUser {
  id: string;
  email?: string;
  role: 'resident' | 'admin' | 'super_admin';
  sanity_person_id?: string;
  onboarding_completed: boolean;
}

// Extended user data from accelr8_users table
export interface SupabaseExtendedUser {
  id: string; // References auth.users(id)
  emergency_contact_name?: string;
  emergency_contact_phone?: string;
  phone_number?: string;
  last_active?: string;
  created_at: string;
  updated_at: string;
}

// Composite user profile type
export interface UserProfile {
  // Base auth data (from SupabaseAuthUser)
  id: string;
  email?: string;
  role: 'resident' | 'admin' | 'super_admin';
  onboarding_completed: boolean;

  // Extended data (from SupabaseExtendedUser)
  extendedData?: {
    emergency_contact_name?: string;
    emergency_contact_phone?: string;
    phone_number?: string;
    last_active?: string;
  };

  // Public profile data (from SanityPerson)
  sanityProfile?: {
    id: string; // Renamed from _id
    name: string;
    slug?: string; // Simplified from slug.current
    profileImage?: SanityImage;
    bio?: string;
    fullBio?: string;
    isTeamMember?: boolean;
    isResident?: boolean;
    houseId?: string; // Simplified from house._ref
    socialLinks?: {
      twitter?: string;
      linkedin?: string;
      github?: string;
      website?: string;
    };
    skills?: string[];
    company?: string;
  };

  // Computed properties
  isAdmin: boolean; // derived from role
  isSuperAdmin: boolean; // derived from role 
  isResident: boolean; // derived from role
}
```

### Rooms and Events

Rooms and events illustrate the power of combining entities across systems:

```typescript
// Room example showing combined operational data with content type reference
export interface Room extends Omit<SupabaseRoom,
  'sanity_house_id' | 'sanity_room_type_id' | 'room_number' |
  'current_resident_id' | 'current_price' | 'lease_start_date' |
  'lease_end_date' | 'last_maintenance_date' | 'last_cleaned_date' |
  'inventory_items' | 'special_notes' | 'created_at' | 'updated_at'> {

  // Normalized properties from Supabase
  roomNumber: string; // renamed from room_number
  currentResidentId?: string;
  currentPrice?: number;
  leaseStartDate?: string;
  leaseEndDate?: string;
  // ...other normalized properties

  // Room type data from Sanity
  type: Omit<SanityRoomType, '_id' | 'house'> & {
    id: string; // renamed from _id
  };

  // House reference data from Sanity
  house: {
    id: string; // renamed from _id
    name: string;
    location?: {
      city?: string;
      state?: string;
    };
  };

  // Computed properties
  isAvailable: boolean; // derived from status
  pricePerMonth: number; // currentPrice or type.basePrice
  daysUntilAvailable?: number; // calculated from leaseEndDate if occupied
}

// Event example showing unified type handling
export interface Event {
  // Common properties
  id: string; // Sanity _id or Supabase id
  title: string;
  description?: string;
  startDateTime: string; // ISO datetime string from either source
  endDateTime: string; // ISO datetime string from either source
  location?: string;
  houseId?: string; // Sanity house _ref or Supabase sanity_house_id
  houseName?: string; // Derived from house reference

  // Source-specific properties
  sanityData?: Omit<SanityEvent, '_id' | 'house' | 'startDateTime' | 'endDateTime' | 'title' | 'shortDescription'> & {
    slug?: string; // simplified from slug.current
    isGlobal: boolean;
    isPublic: boolean;
  };

  operationalData?: Omit<SupabaseHouseEvent,
    'id' | 'sanity_event_id' | 'sanity_house_id' | 'title' |
    'description' | 'start_time' | 'end_time' | 'location' |
    'created_at' | 'updated_at'> & {
      isMandatory: boolean; // renamed from is_mandatory
      // ...other operational data
    };

  // Source indicator
  source: 'sanity' | 'supabase' | 'both';

  // Computed properties
  isPast: boolean; // Based on current time vs endDateTime
  isOngoing: boolean; // Based on current time between start/end
  isUpcoming: boolean; // Based on current time vs startDateTime
  daysUntil?: number; // Days until event starts
}
```
