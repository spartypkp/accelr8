# Accelr8 Website and Dashboard System

## Project Overview

### About Accelr8
Accelr8 is a network of co-living houses for tech founders and builders, primarily focused on AI and Web3. The organization provides housing and community to foster innovation, collaboration, and startup growth.

- **Mission**: Create living spaces that accelerate innovation through community.
- **Current State**: Operating in San Francisco with one house in Nob Hill.
- **Future Vision**: Expand to multiple houses in San Francisco and eventually create a global network.

### Project Goals
This project is developing a comprehensive website and dashboard system for Accelr8 that will:

1. **Create a unified platform** for marketing, application processing, and resident management
2. **Support operational scaling** from a single house to multiple locations
3. **Enhance resident experience** through community and house-specific tools
4. **Empower administrators** with effective house management tools
5. **Enable executive oversight** across the organization's properties

## System Architecture

### Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: Next.js 14 (App Router), React 18, TailwindCSS, ShadCN UI components
- **Backend/Database**:
  - **Supabase**: Authentication, operational data, PostgreSQL database
  - **Sanity CMS**: Content management for marketing and profile content
- **Hosting**: Vercel

### Dual Database Architecture
The system implements a unique dual-database architecture to leverage the strengths of both Sanity CMS and Supabase:

#### Content vs. Operations Split
- **Sanity CMS**: Manages all public-facing content, including:
  - House profiles, amenities, and photos
  - Person profiles and team information
  - Public events and media content
  - Blog posts and marketing materials

- **Supabase**: Handles all operational and transactional data:
  - User authentication and authorization
  - House operations (WiFi, access codes, occupancy)
  - Room bookings and assignments
  - Applications and resident management
  - Internal events and maintenance requests

#### Data Integration Strategy
- **Type Extension Pattern**: TypeScript interfaces extend base types from each source
- **Cross-Database References**: Consistent ID linking between systems
- **Normalized Properties**: Consistent naming conventions across systems

## User Roles and Authorization

The system implements a comprehensive role-based access control system:

### User Roles

#### 1. Applicant
- **Access Level**: Limited
- **Capabilities**:
  - View and manage their application(s)
  - Update personal profile information
  - Access dashboard with application status tracking
  - Configure account settings

#### 2. Resident
- **Access Level**: House-specific
- **Capabilities**:
  - Everything an applicant can do
  - View houses they're a resident of
  - Access resident-specific house features
  - Interact with house community
  - View events and resources
  - Submit maintenance requests
  - Access billing information

#### 3. Admin (House Manager)
- **Access Level**: House-specific management
- **Capabilities**:
  - Everything a resident can do
  - Manage assigned houses
  - View resident information and occupancy
  - Organize house events
  - Process maintenance requests
  - Access house analytics and reports
  - Handle house-specific applications

#### 4. Super Admin
- **Access Level**: Organization-wide
- **Capabilities**:
  - Access to all houses and features
  - Organization-wide analytics
  - User role management
  - System configuration
  - House setup and initialization

### Authorization Implementation

The authorization system is implemented through multiple layers:

1. **Middleware (Route Protection)**
   - All dashboard routes require authentication
   - Role-specific routes are protected based on user role
   - House-specific access is verified against database records

2. **Database-Level Security**
   - Row-level security in Supabase restricts data access
   - Table policies enforce user-specific data access

3. **UI Conditional Rendering**
   - Navigation options only show relevant items per role
   - Components adapt based on user permissions

## Application Structure

### Routing Architecture

The application uses Next.js App Router with a clear routing structure:

```
/ - Public homepage
/story - About Accelr8 and mission
/houses - Public houses listing
/houses/[houseId] - Public house detail page
/apply - Application form
/events - Public events
/login, /register, /forgot-password - Auth pages

/dashboard - Main dashboard and house selection
/dashboard/profile - User profile management
/dashboard/settings - User account settings
/dashboard/applications - Application status (for applicants)

/dashboard/[houseId]/resident - House resident view
/dashboard/[houseId]/resident/* - Resident sub-pages

/dashboard/[houseId]/admin - House admin dashboard 
/dashboard/[houseId]/admin/* - Admin sub-pages

/dashboard/superAdmin - Organization administration
/dashboard/superAdmin/* - Super admin sub-pages
```

### Key Dashboard Components

The dashboard interface is built with a consistent structure:

1. **Shell**: The outer container with navigation
2. **Sidebar**: Role-specific navigation menu
3. **Main Content**: Dynamic page content

### Dashboard Navigation

Navigation is dynamically generated based on:
1. User's role
2. Access to specific houses
3. Current context (admin vs. resident view)

## Middleware Architecture

The authorization system is implemented through Next.js middleware which:

1. **Intercepts Routes**: Checks all requests to protected routes
2. **Verifies Authentication**: Ensures users are logged in
3. **Checks Permissions**: Validates role-based access
4. **Verifies House Access**: For house-specific routes, confirms the user has access to that house
5. **Handles Redirects**: Sends unauthenticated users to login

### Key Middleware Logic:

```typescript
// Role hierarchy for permission checks
const roleHierarchy: Record<UserRole, number> = {
  applicant: 0,
  resident: 1,
  admin: 2,
  super_admin: 3
};

// Check route permissions
if (isMainDashboard || isProfileRoute || isApplicationRoute) {
  // All authenticated users can access these routes
  return response;
}

// Super admin routes require super_admin role
if (isSuperAdminRoute) {
  if (userRole !== 'super_admin') {
    return NextResponse.redirect(new URL('/dashboard', request.url));
  }
  return response;
}

// Check house-specific access and permissions
// ...house access verification logic
```

## Technical Challenges and Solutions

### Cross-Database Integration
**Challenge**: Maintaining consistency between Sanity and Supabase data.
**Solution**: Implemented type extension pattern with strict TypeScript interfaces.

### House-Specific Authorization
**Challenge**: Creating a flexible system for house-specific access.
**Solution**: Database tables track user-house relationships with middleware verification.

### Dynamic Navigation
**Challenge**: Building navigation that adapts to user roles and permissions.
**Solution**: Context-aware sidebar that renders different items based on role and route.

### Performance Optimization
**Challenge**: Managing data fetching from dual sources without excessive requests.
**Solution**: Parallel fetching, data composition, and client-side caching strategies.
