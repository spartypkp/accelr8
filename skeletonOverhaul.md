## Implementation Notes

### Current Focus: Resident Dashboard Integration
We've completed implementing the Maintenance Request System which now allows residents to:
- Create new maintenance requests with title, description, priority, and images
- Track status of existing requests (pending, in progress, completed)
- Add comments to maintenance requests
- Filter and search through maintenance history

The Resource Booking System has been implemented with the following features:
- Display available resources with details (location, capacity, cost)
- Filter resources by type and availability
- Search functionality for finding specific resources
- Calendar-based booking interface with time slot selection
- Availability checking to prevent booking conflicts
- Booking management (create and view personal bookings)

### Next Priorities
1. Community Hub - Implement the event display and RSVP system
2. Billing and Payments Portal - Create payment history display

### Technology Stack
- Next.js 14 with App Router
- Tailwind CSS
- Shadcn UI Components
- Supabase for backend
- Sanity CMS for content management
- TypeScript for type safety

### Data Architecture
The application uses a hybrid data architecture:
- Sanity CMS: Content-heavy data (house info, static content)
- Supabase: User data, transactions, bookings, maintenance requests
- Client-side state: UI state, session management

### Performance Considerations
- Implementing server-side rendering for data-heavy pages
- Using optimistic UI updates for better user experience
- Caching strategies to minimize database reads
